https://www.facebook.com/peter.forth.583; I like very much to program in Win32forth. and also other forths too. I also like to help new programmers with questions around win32forth. Any case you need me you can contact me. Please tell me a bit of your interests in Astronomy and Forth !
SJ HI Peter, thanks for contacting me. I fell in love with Forth 2 months ago, purchased a pile of forth books, downloaded everything i could find on it. Back in 83 i built Tec-1, a z80 mini system from "Talking Electronics" (supported by  https://www.facebook.com/groups/AusVintage/) ..made it my goal of porting Forth to it, but I have just started on this path. I am learning forth with online sims, have installed winforth32 to continue learning. got the source for camelforth as I think it's the smallest to fit the tec-1, then access with terminal, or make it interact with winforth. Astronomy; in 1975 I built a 12.5 inch newtonian reflector, still have it. It has manual controls. I hope to write for xyz controller to drive the telescope. I hope to write many forth sci and ee programs to control and study things.
PF; Your work with astronomy and forth is fantastic ! You can play with my little "planetarium" and add features if you wish. I want to make a Celestial Sphere later and project the Stars on it. And probably later steer my Telescope through wifi, with nodemcu esp8266. https://github.com/PeterForth/Planetarium Please, write a bit of your  astronomy interest and Forth interest in the Win32forth group, as a presentation of you ! So the other members will see your activity and interest  and respond and want to be friends too... we have many Astronomers in that group ! they will love to hear from you
